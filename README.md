Many people face a problem preserving or accessing written historical information in light of technological development and people's dependence on technology in various fields,
and the process of studying written history requires a lot of effort and time in reading and researching historical references.

Our project will be a mobile application called “ZAMAKAN Map” that visualizes the most important people and historical events through eras 
(Modern history of Egypt use case).
The application is useful for schools, universities, students, and historians, 
and it includes a map (Google map) that allows the user to select a country and learn about its history. 

The project's concept is based on visualizing the temporal and spatial dimensions of history and transforming historical information, 
important figures, and historical events from readable form as information to a visual form that allows the user to review the History through a map in a mobile 
application that includes images, brief descriptions, and information of stored Data, and that allows the user to navigate the history of a specific Area through a
slider on the map.

The operation of reviewing the history happened through a slider that changes the year when it moves, 
the application will visualize the history in that year and the visualization process is based on showing a name with a picture of 
important historical events and people in exact location and time (Year).

User can click on any picture or name to view a brief description of it, and also, he can choose a specific person and company to 
follow the historical line on the map.
